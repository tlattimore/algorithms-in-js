## What is this for?

I am working towards learning more computer science algorithms. My hope is that creating this repo will help guilt me into more of that effort. 

Build status provided by CircleCI: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tlattimore/algorithms-in-js.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tlattimore/algorithms-in-js)

## Running the algorithms

I am using [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) for unit testing each algorithm.

Jest can be setup by:

`yarn install` or `npm install`

Then to run the tests:

`yarn test` or `npm run test`
